#BEANCHAIN TX TYPES

## TX (BASE TRANSACTION - BEAN)  
- Type: 'transfer'
- Description: Transfer of native BEAN coin
- Execution: Transfers BEAN between wallets
- Model: TX.java 
- Verifier: TXVerifier.java 
- Status flags: pending, complete, rejected, timed out


## MintTX (MINTING LAYER 2 TOKENS)
- Type: 'mint'
- Description: Mints a new Layer 2 token or adds to an existing open mint. 
- Variants: 
    • `mode: create` -- initial mint 
    • `mode: mintMore` -- supply increase
- Execution: Updates token registry and wallet balances in Layer2DB
- Verifier: MintVerifier.java 
- Metadata: 
    • tokenHash, token, supply, symbol, capped, openMint

## StakeTX (SEND BEAN TO STAKING CONTRACT)
- Type: stake
- Description: Triggers a validator node to initiate a CENCALL to the staking contract
- Execution Flow:
   • StakeTX is sent to the staking contract's address (contract wallet).
   • The validator node detects the stake type and reads the metadata.
   • A CENCALL is generated by the validator node to execute the staking logic.
   • The staking contract receives the BEAN and mints LockedBean via a TokenTX back to the user.
   • Verifier: StakeTXVerifier.java (planned)
   • Handled By: BlockBuilder → CENCALL to StakingContract

Metadata Fields:
   • mode: "stake" or "unStake"
   • tokenHash: (for unStake only, specifies LockedBean token)

Output:

For stake: a TokenTX giving the user LockedBean

For unStake: a TokenTX to remove the LockedBean and a TX returning BEAN in exchange
